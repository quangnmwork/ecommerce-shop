Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.",

With the same dimensions and chipset as the iPhone 12, it’s easy to wonder whether the Pro is worth the extra cash – especially when the iPhone 12 Pro Max is out there with a better camera sensor and longer battery life. There are some useful upgrades here – not least the camera, and the jump to 128GB of storage in the cheapest model, and it also comes in more muted, premium-looking colors. It's the more mature iPhone for sure – but it's tough to say it's got enough to encourage you to upgrade.",
